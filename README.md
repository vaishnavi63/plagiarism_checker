# plagiarism_checker
This a unique plagiarism checker for checking plagiarism among github repos.

**In first snippet** - We have to enter path manually for every iteration. First it will ask how many number of github repos you want to perform plagiarism. And then it will ask for repo link and path of directory where it has to be downloaded. That's it the files in the repo will be downloaded at the mentioned path.

**In second snippet** - We no need to mention path manually. The download path will be the current working directory(cwd).

**In third snippet** - This code snippet is mainly for the users who don't want to download the files in current working directory then the user can use this. You can enter the path of directory in the code.

**The fourth and last snippet is the main module where we train and check the plagiarism of source file with target files.**
